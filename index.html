            My exact title at the moment is Staff Software Engineer at a wonderful company called 
            Ophelia, where I am part of a very small engineering team focused on making evidence-based treatments 
            for opioid use disorder (OUD) accessible to everyone. I was previously a Senior Member of Technical Staff 
            at Oracle, where I served as frontend lead on the the Autonomous Data Science Cloud Service 
            team.

            At first, I wanted to become a lampmaker. I gave that a good faith effort, but ultimately
            ran out of puns to name my creations with. Nevertheless, said lamps are still on display
            at:
            <a href="https://turnmeonlamps.netlify.app">TurnMeOnLamps.com</a>. My next endeavor was to become a
            filmmaker — a truly novel line of work for any native Angeleno. I focused in on an array of
            edgy topics, but ultimately I believe my cinematic style proved too esoteric to ever gain mass appear.
            I'll let you judge <a href="https://black-einstein.netlify.com">my short
            films</a> for yourself. I eventually found a more lasting groove through the world of generative art
            and data visualization designers. That influence turned into a wellspring of creative expression
            that inspired me to pursue software engineering. I haven't looked back once. Here you'll find a link to some of my
            most prized personal artifacts: <a href="https://meinstein.github.io/odad">ODAD</a> and

            I have a J.D. from Southwestern Law School, where I graduated in the top 10% of my
            class - and I have an M.B.A from the Drucker School of Management that was earned as part of a dual degree
            program with my law school. My primary passion during this time of my
            life was not Criminal Law or Mergers and Aquisitions, but rather the Homelessness
            Prevention Law Project, where I served as President. I believe that as a society we are
            far too desensitized to homelessness, which is why I also created a series of filmed
            portraits on the matter:

            I attended the University of California, Santa Barbara, where I earned degrees in Black
            studies and German studies. I wanted to find a link between these two disciplines for my
            senior thesis, but struggled doing so. In the end, I wrote about an issue that is still
            very near and dear to me: education reform. Evidently,

            Broadly speaking, my dialect is known as Swiss-German — aka Schweizerdeutsch, aka
            Schwyzerdütsch, aka Schwiizertüütsch, aka Schwizertitsch — but my particular subdialect
            is Bernese German — aka Berndeutsch, aka Bärndütsch, aka ... you get the point.
